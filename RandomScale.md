Random Scale
========

The `RandomScale` package provides R code to fit a half-normal detection function with a random scale parameter to line transect sampling data. The package also 
contains code to use ADMB [AD Model Builder](http://admb-project.org) through R2admb to fit random scale and mixed-effects models with covariates and a random component.
The TPL files are contained in the Inst sub-directory and some matching example AMDB DAT files in the Data subdirectory.
