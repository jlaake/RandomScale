Random Scale
========

The `RandomScale` package provides R code to fit a random scale half-normal detection function to line transect sampling data. The package also 
contains code to use ADMB [AD Model Builder](http://admb-project.org) through R2admb to fit mixed-effects models with covariates and a random component.

The TPL files are contained in https://github.com/jlaake/RandomScale/tree/master/RandomScale/inst.

Example AMDB DAT files are contained in https://github.com/jlaake/RandomScale/tree/master/RandomScale/Data.
