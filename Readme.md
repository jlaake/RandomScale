Random Scale
========

The `RandomScale` package provides R code to fit a random scale half-normal detection function to line transect sampling data. The package also 
contains R code to use [AD Model Builder](http://admb-project.org) with the R package [R2admb](https://github.com/bbolker/R2admb) to fit mixed-effects models with known covariate values and a random component. 
The ADMB TPL files are contained in the [Inst directory](https://github.com/jlaake/RandomScale/tree/master/RandomScale/inst).
Example AMDB DAT files are contained in the [Data directory](https://github.com/jlaake/RandomScale/tree/master/RandomScale/Data).
