Random Scale
========

The `RandomScale` package provides R code to fit a random scale half-normal detection function to line transect sampling data. The package also 
contains code to use ADMB [AD Model Builder](http://admb-project.org) through R2admb to fit mixed-effects models with covariates and a random component.
The TPL files are contained in the Inst sub-directory (https://github.com/jlaake/RandomScale/tree/master/RandomScale/inst) and some matching example 
AMDB DAT files in the Data sub-directory (https://github.com/jlaake/RandomScale/tree/master/RandomScale/Data).
